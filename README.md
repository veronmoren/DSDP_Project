# DSDP_Project
Data Science Developers Program
The experience of working on this project helped me to understand how to approach very basic concepts of Data Science.  
The more I learn, the more I want to implement new methods and visuals in my project. As well as try other platforms.
This is my first python project, and I really enjoyed the versatility of the language.
I am motivated to continue learning to start building my Data Science skills.  I am planning to find an organization where I can volunteer to help with Data Science projects as an apprentice.
